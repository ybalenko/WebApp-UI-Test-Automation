# Web UI Test Automation

This [repository](https://github.com/ybalenko/WebApp-UI-Test-Automation/tree/main/Selenium-Python) contains scripts and dependencies for running automated [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) UI tests using [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) and Unit testing framework [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).


The basic building blocks of unit testing are test cases. In unittest, test cases are represented by [unittest.TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase) instances.

NOTE: According to the [Python's naming convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), functions and variables names should be stylized as snake_case. However, methods used in [TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase) have mixedCase or camelCase (e.g. setUp(), tearDown(), etc.) So, I had to take this style as a prevailing.
